1. Download zip file, unzip it and double-click `MinimalCountdown.ssaver`
2. You can choose to install this screen saver only into your account or for all users
3. Close `System Settings` and reopen it
4. My current build is not yet notarized so you may see macOS notification _"MinimalCountdown.saver canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."_
5. To fix this issue click `Show in Finder` button, macOS opens `Screen Savers` folder in the Finder
6. Click `Ok` to close the notification alert and `System Settings` window too
7. Hold `Shift` and after that right-click `MinimalCountdown.ssaver` file, then select `Open` in the context menu
8. In the new notification window please click `Open` button
9. Customize the settings to fit your imagination
10. Enjoy it!

**Note:**
If you doubt about this issue, you may clone my repo and try to build the screen saver by yourself.
